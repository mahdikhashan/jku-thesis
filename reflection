I know the project has two parts, ULR, or user language representation and the interface.
To my current understainding, these two are the input of the flow, to receive and accept the scenarios from the user side.

what I know about ULR:

- it probably defines the scope of the user inputs and characterestics
- time keeping is one parameter of it
- in practice, it could be based upon JSON or similar data representation

questions:

- is it a data model(ing) concept? no, its a representation
- is it learnable or it is fixed and defined? i can research about it a bit
- what does it mean, it is expressive?
- what are similar concepts to it? DSL, the next stage of the flow accept it, which is the solver, so it should be correct.

what is the interface here?

what i know:

- it is the first place user interacts with the feature
- it could be a web based user interface like chat interfaces 
- it could have some suggestion or auto-complete features
- it may accept user user input as text, or some other possible inputs,
- it may have some links to other systems (like how agents have tools access)

questions:

- what is the scope of this task, what is the definition of good enough or done?
- what could be the mvp?
- what are the projects that i can get some inspirations from?
