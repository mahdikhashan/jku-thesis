## On personas

- Tech comfort is probably not very relevant to DSL design.
- About the chart:
    * STATE and CAUSE are probably not very useful.
    * REMINDERs are handled already by the backend, we only need to know under which conditions a task is preferable, how long it takes etc.

General remarks:
-  At this point the main goal is to have a DSL that an LLM can map natural language to. User preferences can be studied later.
- The goal of the task scheduler is not to induce productivity through nudges but to offload mental scheduling and reminders to an application.
